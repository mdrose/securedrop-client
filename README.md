Qt-based client for working with SecureDrop submissions on the SecureDrop Qubes Workstation

## Getting Started

Set up a Python 3 virtual environment and set up dependencies:

```
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
```

## Run the client

You can run the client with an ephemeral data directory:

```
./run.sh
```

If you want to persist data across restarts, you will need to run the client with:

```
./run.sh --sdc-home /path/to/my/dir/
```

## Run tests

```
make test
```

## Generate and run database migrations

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your revision here"
alembic upgrade head
```

## Qubes Integration

This client will sit in a Qubes vault AppVM:

It will use the [SecureDrop SDK](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-sdk)
to interact with the [SecureDrop Journalist API](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/journalist_api.html).
Currently, this must be done by running the SecureDrop server dev container. To do this:

1. Follow the instructions [in the SecureDrop documentation](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/setup_development.html#quick-start) to set up the development container. The journalist interface API will be running on `127.0.0.1:8081` with a test
journalist, admin, and test sources and replies.
2. Clone the [SDK repository]((https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-sdk) and install the package in the same virtualenv you are using to develop this client.
3. Now at the Python interpreter you should be able to `import sdclientapi` without issue.

For further development, you should use the SDK methods to interact with the server.
